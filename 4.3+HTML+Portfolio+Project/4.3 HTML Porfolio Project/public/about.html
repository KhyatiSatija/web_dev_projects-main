<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>A curious, tech-savvy, all-rounder, I excel in management and quick learning. I am the go-to person for achieving tasks with a deadline. I am a dedicated, passionate supporter of women's empowerment and equality. 

  Welcome to my Portfolio!
  
   I'm a B.Tech computer science student with a genuine love for exploring cutting-edge technologies and tackling intriguing challenges. My passion for computational thinking knows no bounds, and creativity is my trusted companion in this journey.
  
  Surprisingly, my academic path started in biology, but as fate would have it, I discovered a whole new world of excitement through app and web development projects. Now, I'm thrilled with where life is taking me!
  
  In my spare time, you can catch me hitting the gym, diving into self-help books, or watching Big Bang Theory .
